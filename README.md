 CPI Inflation Analysis

 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** inflation trends across different categories to study **pre- and post-COVID patterns**. The analysis helps in understanding how global events, such as the pandemic, influenced inflation in sectors like food, fuel, transport, and healthcare.

Tools & Technologies
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, formula-based calculations, and pivot tables  
- **Formulas Used**: `AVERAGEIFS`, `PERCENTAGE CHANGE`, correlation functions  
- **Charts & Visualizations**: Bar charts, line graphs, and trend analysis  

Key Insights
- Inflation trends varied significantly across categories during and after COVID.  
- Fuel and transport showed a stronger correlation with oil prices.  
- Food and health categories were less volatile but showed steady growth.
